LEARN LEARN LEARN. THE WORLD DOES NOT CARE ABOUT LOSERS. HONESTLY, IT'S TRUE. ONLY IF I ACHIEVE SOMETHING, WILL ANYONE SEE THIS REPO. BUT WHY WHY WHY. WHY DO PEOPLE NOT CARE ABOUT LOSING? I CAME TO ONE CONCLUSION AT THIS POINT. THE TRUTH IS PEOPLE DO NOT CARE ABOUT WINNING OR LOSING. PEOPLE ONLY LEECH ON SELF-DESIRES. THEY WANT TO COPY OR IMITATE. I DO NOT WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM. I WANT TO BE ORIGINAL. FEED ON MY TALENT AND BELIEVE IN ME. I WISH TO CHANGE MYSELF. I WANT TO BECOME RICH THROUGH SHEER WILL, DETERMINATION, AND GRIT. I DONNA WANNA LIE AND PUT IT ON MY FAMILY. I WANT TO BECOME ONE BECAUSE I WANT TO. I WANT TO LEARN BUILD LEARN BUILD FAIL. AS I ALWAYS BELIEVE, FAILURE TEACHES ME A PLETHORA OF THINGS. BELIEVE IN YOUR INSTINCT AND BELIEVE IN YOUR INTUITION AND MOST IMPORTANT, NEVER EVER DEFEAT. AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANY MEDIOCRAT LIFE NOT ANYMORE. IF I WANT TO CHANGE, MAN I HAVE TO PUT MYSELF OUT THERE. I LOST HONESTLY. IN RELATIONSHIPS, MY FRIENDS AND MY JOB OFFERS. BUT THIS TIME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT. I HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND I AM NOT AFRAID ANYMORE. I WILL WIN.
